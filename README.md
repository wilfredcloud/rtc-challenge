**Challenge: Build a real-time communication system using WebRTC technology.**

- The platform should support video and audio calls
- The platform should be able to handle multiple concurrent users and sessions.
- The platform should be able to handle potential network interruptions and reconnections.
- The platform should be built using Angular (with TypeScript), HTML, and Angular Material UI or Pure CSS
- Use backend technology to build your signaling server (preferably node, deno, or any python web framework)

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- Functionality: Can the platform handle video and audio calls with multiple users?
- Scalability: Can the platform handle multiple concurrent users and sessions?
- Resilience: Can the platform handle potential network interruptions and reconnections?
- Code Quality: Is the code readable, maintainable, and well-organized?
